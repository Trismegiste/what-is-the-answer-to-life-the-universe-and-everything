# what is the answer to life the universe and everything website

Homage to [Douglas Adams][42]

## Feel free to contribute !

This [Silex][2] app belongs to the very strange [single serving sites][1] club like :

 * http://www.turnofftheinternet.com
 * http://www.thispagecannotbedisplayed.com
 * http://www.khaaan.com
 * http://www.sometimesredsometimesblue.com

The unique controller scans the directory /views/answer for [Twig][3] templates
and renders randomly one of them.

Currently you can haZ [PureCSS][4] but I will consider to add another CSS framework like Twitter Bootstrap
or Zurb Foundation.
