# What is the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything website

Homage to [Douglas Adams][42]

## WTF ?

Check the result at http://whatistheanswertolifetheuniverseandeverything.info/

## Feel free to contribute !

This [Silex][2] app belongs to the very strange [single serving sites][1] club like :

 * http://www.turnofftheinternet.com
 * http://www.thispagecannotbedisplayed.com
 * http://www.khaaan.com
 * http://www.sometimesredsometimesblue.com

The unique controller scans the directory /views/answer for [Twig][3] templates
and renders randomly one of them.

Currently you can haZ [PureCSS][4] but I will consider to add another CSS framework like Twitter Bootstrap.
or Zurb Foundation.

## What about javascript ?

No javascript will be added. Use HTML5 and CSS3 to make fancy animations, that's the challenge.

## Requirements

Prefer mobile devices and last versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE >= 10 )
